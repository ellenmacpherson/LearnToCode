# LearnToCode
A list of resources for #codenewbies. 

Looking to start your journey in code? This is a growing list of (largely) free resources for teaching yourself how to code. Much of the material covers web development and Python, but there are some general recommendations as well. For those looking to explore tech skills related to code, there's also a section for learning skills like UX. 

All resources are marked free or paid. They are only marked as paid if the vast majority or entirety of the content is under a paywall. I've done my best to pick affordable sources.
