# LearnToCode
A list of resources for #codenewbies. 

Looking to start your journey in code? This is a growing list of (largely) free resources for teaching yourself how to code. Much of the material covers web development and Python, but there are some general recommendations as well. For those looking to explore tech skills related to code, there's also a section for learning skills like UX. 

All resources listed here are free unless they have a :moneybag: symbol. This is aside from books, which can either be bought or borrowed.  I have only included paid sources I have used myself and that I trust are good quality, and relatively affordable. They are by no means a must-purchase; working diligently, you can learn enough to start freelancing just from the free sources here. 

## Dip Your Toes In

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) 

The first place I, and thousands of others, ever started coding.  

What it's good for: Getting your first lines of code written. It's an accessible and enjoyable way to start your code journey. Courses are relatively short, and allow you to get a feel for several programming languages.
What it's not as good at: Computer science principles, algorithms and logic. 

[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

What it's good for: Algorithms, getting your first lines of code written.
What it's not as good at: It's not as practical/project-based as Codecademy. 

[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)

What it's good for: Interactivity. Videos and code in the same screen makes it easy to play around and reinforce learning.
What it's not as good for: It doesn't have as broad a range of subjects as other beginner platforms. Mostly focused on Web dev.

What it's good for: Career-track courses.

## Video Courses

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - free to audit courses.

[MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/)
:moneybag:[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) - make sure to keep an eye out for sales where you can buy courses for a fraction of their full price. These happen so often that I never recommend buying a full-price course.
