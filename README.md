# LearnToCode
A list of resources for #codenewbies. 

Looking to start your journey in code? This is a growing list of (largely) free resources for teaching yourself how to code to understand what goes on in the world of software engineering. Much of the material covers web development and Python, but there are some general recommendations as well. For those looking to explore tech skills related to code, there's also a section for learning skills like UX. 

No one source here will teach you everything. Have a play around with several different websites to get a more holistic learning experience.

All resources listed here are free unless they have a :moneybag: symbol. This is aside from books, which I've left as 'free', as they can either be bought or borrowed.  I have only included paid sources I have used myself and that I trust are good quality, as well as relatively affordable. They are by no means a must-purchase. Working diligently, you can learn enough to start freelancing just from the free sources here. 

## Dip Your Toes In

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) 

The first place I, and thousands of others, ever started coding.  

Great for getting your first lines of code written. It's an accessible and enjoyable way to start your code journey. Courses are relatively short, and allow you to get a feel for several programming languages. It's not so great at teaching computer science principles, algorithms and logic. 

[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

Great for learning how to write more algorithmic code, and getting your first lines of code written. However, it's not as practical/project-based as Codecademy. 

[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)

A fantastic, really original, interactive way to learn code. Videos and code in the same screen makes it easy to play around and reinforce your learning.  It doesn't have as broad a range of subjects as other beginner platforms. Mostly focused on Web dev.

:moneybag:[Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/)

The folks at Treehouse say equity, diversity and inclusion is a priority for them. Great career-track courses.

## Video Courses

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)

It's completely free to audit courses, but if you want a degree or course certification, you'll have to get your wallet out.

[CS50](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcabW7890RKJzL968QWEykA)

A brilliant introduction to computer science principles from one of the most passionate teachers I've ever seen. A great resource for those of us without computer science degrees. 

[MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/)

Again, a great place to access free computer science modules if you're looking to dip your toes into university-level concepts. 

:moneybag:[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) 
Not free, but can certainly be very affodable. Keep an eye out for sales where you can buy courses for a fraction of their full price. These happen so often that I never recommend buying a full-price course.

:moneybag:[Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/)

Not the most afforable resource on this list and probably not for complete beginners, but there's some really impressive talent teaching these courses. Very high-quality.


## Youtubers
[Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb)
All things web development - full-stack or front-end. All of it. There's a ridiculous amount of great content here. He also gives career and tech advice. 

[Wes Bos](https://www.youtube.com/user/wesbos)
Another web development heavyweight. Particularly great at explaining React.

[Blondie Bytes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4DwZ2VXM2KWtzHjVk9M_xg)
Full stack, quick code tutorials.

[sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/sentdex)
Python, machine learning, data science.

[Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5)
Python for web development. 

[The Cherno Project](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject)
C++, game development, coffee.

[Anna Lytical](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK-XsdHry-tJ2IsNOHTGdcA)
Just for a bit of fun, learn to code with a drag queen!

## Books

[The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition) - Andy Hunt, Dave Thomas

This is really THE starting point for the wave of Agile development we're seeing in the industry. Full of great advice on how to take a requirements and turn them into working, maintanable code. Covers topics ranging from personal responsibility to career development to architecture. 

I've linked to the 20th Anniversary Edition which updates some of the more outdated content and makes the language more inclusive. However, if you're cash-strapped, the original still contains all the relevant key concepts you'll need to know and can be found for a more affordable price on Amazon.

[Clean Code: a Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/) - Robert C. Martin.

There's no doubt: this was definitely written in a time where software development was a less inclusive space. Despite its language and tone being a little outdated, the advice on how to write clean code in this book is really crucial for every aspiring developer. Almost every developer I know has a PDF copy on their machine. 

[HTML & CSS](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/) and [JavaScript and JQuery](http://javascriptbook.com/) - Jon Duckett

Fantastic resources for learning the basics of web development. Great for visual learners.

[You Don't Know Javascript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

A series of books diving deep into the core mechanisms of the JavaScript language, sponsored by Frontend Masters. Not for complete beginners, but once you have a good understanding of the basics this is a good resource for diving deeper into the quirks of JS. 

[JavaScript: The Good Parts](https://github.com/NorthPaulo/research/blob/master/Frontend-books%26research/JavaScript%20-%20The%20Good%20Parts%20-%20Douglas%20Crockford%20-%20May%202008.pdf)

Similarly to You Don't Know Javascript, this is a good resource for breaking down and understanding the trickier parts of the JS language. 

[Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Intrduction to Programming](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based-ebook/dp/B018UXJ9RI)

This thing is a *tome*, but you won't find another book that's more comprehensive or accessible on learning Python. Very project-based, which makes it good fun.
