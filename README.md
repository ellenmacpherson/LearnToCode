# LearnToCode
A list of resources for #codenewbies. 

Looking to start your journey in code? This is a growing list of (largely) free resources for teaching yourself how to code. Much of the material covers web development and Python, but there are some general recommendations as well. For those looking to explore tech skills related to code, there's also a section for learning skills like UX. 

No one source here will teach you everything. Have a play around with several different websites to get a more holistic learning experience.

All resources listed here are free unless they have a :moneybag: symbol. This is aside from books, which I've left as 'free' as they can either be bought or borrowed.  I have only included paid sources I have used myself and that I trust are good quality, as well as relatively affordable. They are by no means a must-purchase. Working diligently, you can learn enough to start freelancing just from the free sources here. 

## Dip Your Toes In

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) 

The first place I, and thousands of others, ever started coding.  

Great for getting your first lines of code written. It's an accessible and enjoyable way to start your code journey. Courses are relatively short, and allow you to get a feel for several programming languages. It's not so good at computer science principles, algorithms and logic. 

[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

Great for learning how to write more algorithmic code, and getting your first lines of code written. However, it's not as practical/project-based as Codecademy. 

[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)

A fantastic, really original, interactive way to learn code. Videos and code in the same screen makes it easy to play around and reinforce your learning.  It doesn't have as broad a range of subjects as other beginner platforms. Mostly focused on Web dev.

:moneybag:[Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/)

Great for career-track courses.

## Video Courses

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - it's free to audit courses.

[CS50](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcabW7890RKJzL968QWEykA)

A brilliant introduction to computer science principles. A great resource for those of us without computer science degrees. 

[MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/)

Again, a great place to access free computer science modules if you're looking to dip your toes into university-level concepts. 

:moneybag:[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) - make sure to keep an eye out for sales where you can buy courses for a fraction of their full price. These happen so often that I never recommend buying a full-price course.
